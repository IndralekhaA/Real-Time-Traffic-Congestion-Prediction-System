# Real-Time-Traffic-Congestion-Prediction-System

## Overview

The **Real-Time Traffic Congestion Prediction System** aims to predict traffic congestion levels in real-time for various locations using historical traffic data, machine learning models, and a streaming pipeline. The project will involve data collection, preprocessing, building predictive models, and deploying a real-time system.

## Motivation

Traffic congestion is a growing problem in urban areas. Predicting traffic congestion in real-time can help commuters plan better, reduce fuel consumption, and improve the overall transportation experience. This project will demonstrate how machine learning, data engineering, and cloud technologies can be combined to solve this problem.

## Features
- Real-time traffic data ingestion.
- Machine learning-based traffic congestion prediction.
- Scalable and deployable solution using cloud infrastructure.
- Data visualization for insights and analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
- **Data Processing**: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark
- **Data Storage**: AWS S3 (for raw data), PostgreSQL (for processed data)
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS or Google Cloud
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pip or Conda for dependency management

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IndralekhaA/real-time-traffic-prediction.git
   cd real-time-traffic-prediction
2. Install dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up a virtual environment for Python:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
4. Create a .env file to store sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, etc.
   Example .env:
   ```bash
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   Be sure to add .env to your .gitignore file to keep it out of version control.

## Dependencies
   pandas - For data manipulation
   scikit-learn - For machine learning models
   tensorflow - For deep learning (if using neural networks)
   requests - For API calls to retrieve real-time traffic data
   apache-kafka - For real-time data streaming
   flask - For API deployment (if needed)
   psycopg2 - For PostgreSQL database connection

# Install these with the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Data Ingestion: To ingest real-time traffic data from an external API, run the following script:
   ```bash
   python data_ingestion.py
   ```
2. Traffic Prediction: To run the traffic prediction model:
   ```bash
   python predict_traffic.py
   ```
3.  For model training and evaluation:
   ```bash
   python model_training.py
   ```
