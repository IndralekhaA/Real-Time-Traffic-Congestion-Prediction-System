# Real-Time-Traffic-Congestion-Prediction-System

## Overview

The **Real-Time Traffic Congestion Prediction System** aims to predict traffic congestion levels in real-time for various locations using historical traffic data, machine learning models, and a streaming pipeline. The project will involve data collection, preprocessing, building predictive models, and deploying a real-time system.

## Motivation

Traffic congestion is a growing problem in urban areas. Predicting traffic congestion in real-time can help commuters plan better, reduce fuel consumption, and improve the overall transportation experience. This project will demonstrate how machine learning, data engineering, and cloud technologies can be combined to solve this problem.

## Features
- Real-time traffic data ingestion.
- Machine learning-based traffic congestion prediction.
- Scalable and deployable solution using cloud infrastructure.
- Data visualization for insights and analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
- **Data Processing**: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark
- **Data Storage**: AWS S3 (for raw data), PostgreSQL (for processed data)
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS or Google Cloud
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
